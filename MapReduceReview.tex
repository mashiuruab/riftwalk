\paragraph{}
MapReduce is a user friendly configurable model to do computation on data intensive real world tasks in a distributed environment. 
The users only specify function map and reduce to do the computation while all the other tasks (paraller processing, fault tolerance, 
scheduling, efficient network and disk usage) is managed by the framework.

\paragraph{}
The abstraction designed by the authors was inspired by the map and reduce primitive present in many functional language (like Lisp). 
The authors have shown that, each problem can be designed in a way to map the input records to Map functions to generate intermediate 
key/value pairs and then apply Reduce functions to those pairs to combine derived data. The functional model with user specified Map 
and Reduce function facilitate the parallelization of large computation where reexecution is used as the primary mechanism for fault 
tolerance.
